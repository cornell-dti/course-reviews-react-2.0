# Install & Run

    npm install
    meteor npm install

To populate your local database with course data, uncomment lines 379-382 in `/imports/api/classes.js`. Do not make changes to the code as classes are being added (once there are no additional "new class: ..." statements printed in the terminal, all classes have been added). Re-comment the above lines to prevent continuous repopulation of the database.

You can access the app at http://localhost:3000.
